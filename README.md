# Python Avoiding Game

This is a simple avoiding game using the Pygame library. A user  controls a ship using the left and right arrow-keys to avoid incoming fireballs. The user has 3 lives and once all lives are used up, the game ends. A highscore is kept throughout the life of the program. Press "Q" to quit at any point.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Pygame.

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

Run the program with the following command once Pygame is installed.

```bash
python3 main.py
```
